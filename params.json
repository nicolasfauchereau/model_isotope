Lorrey, Tom H. Brookman, Michael N. Evans, Nicolas C. Fauchereau, Margaret Barbour, Cate Macinnis-Ng, Alison Criscitiello, Greg Eisheid, Anthony M. Fowler, Travis Horton and Daniel P. Schrag*\r\n\r\nSubmitted to *Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmosphere*, 2015.\r\n\r\nIt basically consists of an [IPython](www.ipython.org) notebook and a couple of csv files containing environmental parameters (Relative Humidity, Air Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure, Wind speed) as well as *observed* (derived by isotopic techniques) delta 18O values for Kauri (Agathis Australis) tree-rings.\r\n\r\nThe code for this model originates from an Excel file provided by Dr. Margaret Barbour, and follows the BFRE04 model, augmented with a leaf energy balance model\r\n\r\nAll code and data is available on github at:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/model_isotope](https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/model_isotope)\r\n\r\nSee diagram below, which depicts a flow chart related to Figure 3 in the manuscript. The calculations associated with each major part of the flow chart are found in Supplementary Workbook 1.\r\n\r\n<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolasfauchereau/model_isotope/master/figures/Lorreyetal2015SF.jpg' width=800>\r\n\r\nIPython notebooks are now rendered as HTML on github, follow [this link](https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/model_isotope/blob/master/notebooks/forward_model_explicit_widgetsop.ipynb) for a static version.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Installation instructions\r\n\r\nTo read and run this IPython notebook, you need:\r\n\r\n+ Python, available at [www.python.org]()\r\n\r\nand the following libraries\r\n\r\n+ [IPython](http://ipython.org/)\r\n+ [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)\r\n+ [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)\r\n+ [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)\r\n+ [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)\r\n+ [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)\r\n\r\nAll of these are freely available at the link provided and are generally available through the package manager of any modern Linux distribution.\r\n\r\nHowever, we recommend using one of the excellent free, platform independent Scientific Python distributions, such as\r\n\r\n+ Anaconda, from Continuum Analytics: [https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)\r\n+ Canopy express, from Enthought: [https://www.enthought.com/downloads/](https://www.enthought.com/downloads/)\r\n+ pyzo: [http://www.pyzo.org/](http://www.pyzo.org/)\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed one of these, please test the installation by running (the chevrons indicate a terminal emulator)\r\n\r\n    >> ipython notebook\r\n\r\nThis should open the IPython notebook dashboard. Choose \"New Notebook\" and in the input cell, try importing the above libraries:\r\n\r\n    import numpy\r\n    import scipy\r\n    import pandas\r\n    import matplotlib\r\n    import statsmodels\r\n\r\nIf all of the above imports smoothly, you should be able to run the notebook provided as supplementary material to our paper.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Running instructions\r\n\r\nThe archive for the paper's supplementary material, available on github, is organized into 3 directories:\r\n\r\n+ **notebooks**: Contains the IPython notebook itself, named *forward_model_explicit.ipynb*\r\n+ **figures**: is where the figures are saved\r\n+ **excel**: should contain two csv files\r\n    1. *inputs.csv* are observed or estimated *environmental parameters* for the model, i.e. annual:\r\n     - Relative Humidity (%)\r\n     - Air Temperature (degrees Celsius)\r\n     - Pressure (hPa)\r\n     - wind speed (m/s)\r\n\r\n    2. *observed_tree_rings.csv* contains the annual *observed* Delta O18 values for Kauri tree-rings, it contains 2 columns:\r\n     - 'av': annual averages\r\n     - 'std': annual standard deviation\r\n\r\nPlease follow the template provided in the csv files for the naming of the columns.\r\n\r\nAfter unpacking the archive, cd into the *notebooks* directory and run:\r\n\r\n    >> ipython notebook\r\n\r\nYou should then be able to run the model, we recommend you run it sequentially, cell by cell, using the '|>' button in the notebook's toolbar\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor all questions regarding the code itself or the installation of the required libraries, please contact Dr. Nicolas Fauchereau at:\r\n\r\n+ [Nicolas.Fauchereau@gmail.com](mailto:Nicolas.Fauchereau@gmail.com)\r\n+ [Nicolas.Fauchereau@niwa.co.nz](mailto:Nicolas.Fauchereau@niwa.co.nz)\r\n\r\nFor all questions regarding the model, data and methodology, please contact Dr. Andrew Lorrey at:\r\n\r\n+ [Andrew.Lorrey@niwa.co.nz](mailto:Andrew.Lorrey@niwa.co.nz)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
